"""
vapi_service.py — Vapi API Integration

This service triggers outbound AI voice calls via Vapi's REST API.

HOW VAPI WORKS:
- Vapi is an AI voice platform. It handles: phone dialing, speech-to-text,
  LLM conversation, and text-to-speech — all in one API call.
- We just tell it: "Call this number, use this assistant, with this prompt."
- Vapi calls the person, has an AI conversation, then sends us the result via webhook.

We DON'T handle any audio processing ourselves. Vapi does everything.

    Trigger an outbound AI voice call to a customer via Vapi.

    Args:
        customer: dict with keys: _id, name, phone, company_id

    Returns:
        vapi_call_id: string — Vapi's unique ID for tracking this call

    The key trick: We pass customer_id and company_id as "metadata"
    so that when Vapi calls our webhook later, we know which customer
    this call was for.
