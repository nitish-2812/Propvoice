seed.py — Database Seeder

Run this script ONCE to populate your MongoDB with test data:
  python seed.py

It creates:
- 2 companies (Sunrise Realty + Urban Nest Apartments)
- 6 customers (3 per company)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Replace phone numbers with REAL numbers you can answer!
Otherwise you won't be able to test the AI voice calls.

The script clears existing data first, so you can re-run it safely.
